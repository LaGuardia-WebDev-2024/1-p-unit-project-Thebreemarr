      <h2> Why I Like Them</h2>
      
        <ul>
      <li>  I love <strong> seahorses </strong> because last winter, I saw 2 seahorses that got washed up on the beach and were still 
        alive so I threw them back in the ocean and saved their lives. </li>
          <li> I love <strong> fluffy catapillars</strong> becasue when I was a kid I would always let them crawl on my arms and to this day, I still love picking them up. I think they are so adorable and I love fluffy things.  </li>
          <li>Ive <em>LOVED</em> <strong>blobfish </strong> ever since my frinds took me to the arcade 2 winters ago and we all won blobfish stuffies. I love my blobfish so much because they are misunderstood. Everyone says they are ugly but I think they are really funny and sweet. I also love blobfish because they hold the memory of me and my bestfriend's first time going to the arcade and an amazing night we spent together.</li>
          <li>I love the <strong>white Ibis </strong> because when my family visited florida a few years ago, the white Ibis caught my eye. I think they are so cute and funny becuase of their bright read head, legs, and beak in contrast to their entirely white bodys. The White Ibis remind me of the amazing weeks me and my family spend in florida every year and I always look forward to seeking these birds in florida when we visit.</li>
          <li>Finally, my #1 favorite animal is my <strong>dog, Toby.</strong> We adopted him last winter from a shelter in Pensylvania, and he is now 1 year old. He is a super well behaved, sweet, fluffy, playful little puppy and I love him with my whole heart. </li>
        </ul>
